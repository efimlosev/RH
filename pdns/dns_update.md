# Workoround Virtualizator - a VPS Management Panel


The mentioned VPS panel is a pretty handy thing though, I would never prefer to see what is inside it. It offers an integration with your Powerdns as a GUI and It uses pure MySQL request, as  a result  [a serial](https://superuser.com/questions/826658/purpose-of-serial-number-in-dns-zone-files) never updates.
I would like to [share](dns_update.sh) my solution with the comunity.
